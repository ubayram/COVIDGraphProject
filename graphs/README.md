The "graph_postCOVID_final_netx.gml.gz" file contains the complete graph. Meanwhile the zipped files contains subgraphs sampled from the complete graph using the python file present in this folder. There are five different zip files, because the random sampling process was repeated five times as explained in the publication "The Unknown Knowns: A Graph-Based Approach for Temporal COVID-19 Literature Mining".


These graphs are created for a research project, published in OIR 2021. If you use any of them, please cite:
